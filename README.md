# JavaTypes-Variables-Branching

Java Types, Variables, and Branching homework

Exercises: 
 Create a small program that defines some fields. Try creating some illegal field names and see what kind of error the
 compiler produces. Use the naming rules and conventions as a guide. In the program you created, try leaving the fields 
 uninitialized and print out their values. Try the same with a local variable and see what kind of compiler errors you can produce. 
 Becoming familiar with common compiler errors will make it easier to recognize bugs in your code.
